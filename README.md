# [UK-Crime-Map | An interactive map of crime in the UK](https://thatguywiththatname.github.io/UK-Crime-Map/)

Uses [UK Police data](https://data.police.uk) to gather the location of crimes in a radius around the blue marker

## Usage:

 - Drag the blue marker to a location
 - Each red marker is the approximate location of a crime
 - Hover over a red marker to see the first crime committed in that specific location

## ToDo

 - Fix placing a marker for each crime. It should be 1 marker per lat/long, so that it does not break when 1000's of markers are placed ontop of eachother
